# Engine-RUL-Prediction

## RUL Prediction on CMAPSS Dataset using LSTM & GRU
This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines using deep learning models â€” LSTM and GRU â€” on the CMAPSS FD001 dataset. The models are trained on multivariate time series data to estimate how many cycles remain before engine failure.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
Provided by NASAâ€™s Prognostics Center of Excellence, the CMAPSS dataset includes four subsets:

Dataset	Train Engines	Test Engines	Conditions	Fault Modes
FD001	100	100	1       (Sea Level)	1 (HPC Degradation)
FD002	260	259	6	1 (HPC Degradation)
FD003	100	100	1 (Sea Level)	2 (HPC, Fan Degradation)
FD004	248	249	6	2 (HPC, Fan Degradation)

Each engine runs from a healthy state to system failure. The objective is to predict RUL from a given point in time using sensor and setting data.

### ðŸ”¬ Experimental Scenario

* Each time series represents a different engine trajectory.

* Engines start with unknown wear and degrade over time.

* Training sequences end at failure; test sequences end before failure.

* Goal: Predict how many cycles remain (RUL) at each test point.

Data includes:

* 3 operational settings

* 21 sensor measurements 

* 1 unit number and 1 time index per row

### ðŸ§  Models Used

We implemented two deep learning models for RUL regression:

#### âœ… LSTM

* Captures long-term dependencies in sequential sensor data.

* Performs better in modeling engine degradation patterns.

#### âœ… GRU

* More efficient with fewer parameters.

* Faster to train but slightly less accurate in this task.
